# Password Generator Starter Code
#Andre Moseley

**Description:** 
This application will allow an employee generate a random password based on their choice of criteria. I updated the codebase to include the password generator features using Javascript.

**User Story**
- AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
- I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
- SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

**Acceptance Criteria**
- GIVEN I need a new, secure password
- WHEN I click the button to generate a password
- THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
- WHEN prompted for password criteria
- THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
- WHEN prompted for the length of the password
- THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
- WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
- THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
- WHEN I answer each prompt
- THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
- WHEN all prompts are answered
- THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
- WHEN the password is generated
- THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
